# C_rebellion
My prof says it's pointless learning C, so naturally, I'm learning it.

- I'm familiar with C++.

## Notes

**To compile (via cmd)**

```gcc -o filename filename.c```

```filename```

- Declaration 
```
#define PI     3.141592
```

## Understanding 

- preprocessor: only knows about lines of text. 
- ```a #``` is a preprocessor directive
